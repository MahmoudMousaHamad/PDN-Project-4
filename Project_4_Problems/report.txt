Problem 1 & 2

Implementation          Steps on GPU        5M      10M
serial_mining.c         None                
gpu_mining_starter.cu   1                   
gpu_mining_problem1.cu  1, 2                
gpu_mining_problem2.cu  1, 2, 3             


Problem 3

Implementation                              Wall-clock runtime 
serial                                      0.370
Copying data from host to device            0.0759
Launching kernel                            0.0100
Copying data from device to host            0.0494            

Compute-to-global-memory-access ratio estimation: 

1. Compute-device-memory-access ratio is 1 because we have two FLOPs

Problem 4

Implementation                              Wall-clock runtime 
serial                                      0.777
Copying data from host to device            0.00745
Running kernel 1 for convolution            0.0122 
Running kernel 2 for max-pooling            0.00704
Copying data from device to host            0.0495

Compute-to-global-memory-access ratio estimation: 
Compute-device-memory-access ratio is 2 because we only have one device memory access.
